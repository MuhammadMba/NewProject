            Talent Sports Academy was founded on the 22nd of Feb, 2012. Since 2012, we have worked on signing deals in many
            countries to allow us permission to build new stadiums and use their already existing grounds. All of our work was
            completed in recently in 2024 near Mid October. We had allowed teams to start to enter our Academy in the January of
            this 2025 year as a chance of allowing teams like Pakistan, India, Australia, England among many others to practice
            for the Upcoming Champions Trophy being held in Pakistan. In April we also allowed emerging under 19 Players to
            train here and take part in our lessons with retired legends or amazing coaches around the Globe. Our Main Head
            Quarters is in Pakistan but we have operational Head Quarters in almost every Cricket Playing Nation.</p>
